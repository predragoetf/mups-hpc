## Game of Life and molecular dynamics (N-Body problem) parallelization and comparative performance analysis (C, OpenMP, MPI, CUDA)

-	Directive-driven parallelization, message passing and GPGPU were used in conjunction with high-performance computation optimizations to improve execution times 
-	Also includes a comparative analysis of the different parallelization methodologies and approaches
- Implemented as a part of the undergraduate course in [Multiprocessor Systems](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en/fis/karton_predmeta/13S114MUPS2) on the [School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en)
